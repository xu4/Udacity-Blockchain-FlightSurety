## Assumptions of the DAPP for simplicity 
1. Only one airline is registered. The airline was registered when the contract is deployed and it was funded.
2. 3 flights with hardcoded timestamp are registered and populate in the dropdown
3. We use one passenger account. 
4. The "Get insurance amount" and "Get credit balance" buttons will query the contract using the flight selected in "Submit to Oralces" section
5. After "Withdraw credits" button is clicked, you can use "Get credit balance" button to check that the credit balance is 0.
